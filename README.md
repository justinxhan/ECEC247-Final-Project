# ECEC247-Final-Project
BCI Competition: Classification of EEG Signals

Full_Version contains the full project. It compares a CNN to a CNN+GRU and CNN+LSTM architecture for classifying EEG data.

CNN_over_time and CNNLSTM_over_time are variations that show the performance of the respective neural networks over time.

EEG data for this code can be found at the BCI Competition link here: https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/
